# Sample Code: Basic Storage and Auth SDK Integration

The repository `basic-storage-wallet-integration` contains sample code to demonstrate how you can integrate your [Vue JavaScript Framework](https://vuejs.org/) UI application with Arcana [Auth](https://github.com/arcana-network/auth) and [Storage](https://github.com/arcana-network/storage) SDKs.

It does not have any code for invoking other features and functions of these integrated SDKs.  Check out Arcana [Sample Demo App](https://github.com/arcana-network/demo-app) repository for a full fledged sample dApp that integrates with Arcana SDKs and plugs in Auth and Storage functionalities.
